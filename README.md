# Ein-C-Blog
This is a mern full stack advanced blog like social media posts.

This is my first full stack project . I really enjoyed during this journey of learning and applying untill i made this project . 
My next step is to enrich my knowledge and my experience . 

I love this feeling of Passion , what an amazing field to work in.

I will later explain how to use this blog or the api if you want only to create a front-end project .

there is a problem with a contribution graph , I have to make a commit from website to count previous contributions from the terminal.
